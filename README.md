## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (make sure you have the latest stable version installed).

2. A code editor with [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) plugin (or anything at your preference).

3. A performant terminal with image rendering support (is good to have). We recommend [`wezterm`](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).

### Setup

Simply start by cloning this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orhun/rustlab2024-ratatui-workshop
```

Your job is to implement a terminal client for a chat application using Ratatui!

[**Click here to start the workshop**](./workshop/00_intro.md)! ‚û°Ô∏è

Start reading through the chapters and sometimes you will be asked to implement some parts of the application. Don't worry, the solutions are also provided! :)

Let us know if you got stuck somewhere or if you think something is wrong!

### Presenting

You can also present this workshop at your local Rust meetup or conference!

There are minimal slides included in the `presentation.md` file. You can use [`presenterm`](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm) to start the presentation:

```sh
presenterm -c config.yml presentation.md
```

Don't forget to [_tweet_](https://x.com/orhundev) at us!
